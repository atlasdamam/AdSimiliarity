    <p><strong>*</strong> <u><strong>Eligibility:</strong></u> <strong>Must  be a resident of IL</strong>.  New personal checking account must be opened and you must enroll in  this offer by July 1, 2013. Bank of America may change or terminate  this offer before this date without notice.

A  “qualifying Direct Deposit” is a recurring direct deposit of a  paycheck, pension, Social Security or other eligible regular monthly  income, electronically deposited by an employer or an outside agency  into your new checking account.</p>
    <p><u><strong>Additional  Terms and Conditions</strong></u>:  We will make every attempt to deposit the incentive directly into  your Bank of America personal checking account within 60 days of your  meeting all of the qualifications; if unable to do so, a check will  be issued. New personal checking account must be open and in good  standing in order to receive the cash incentive. Your  account does not qualify for the cash incentive until you provide all  of the information we require in connection with opening the account  by the promotion end date.
