            <p>Look, you're not going to get rich doing this. But if an extra $50 to $500 a month would help, then this might be for you. Read on.</p> 
            <p>If you are the kind of person that enjoys giving your opinions about new products and services and getting paid for it, then <b>you've found something you're going to really enjoy</b>.</p> 
            <p>And the best part is that <b>this service is NO COST to you</b>.</p> 
            <p>Here's what it's all about. My name is Hailey Gates and I'm a stay at home mom of three young children. I have been making money taking surveys at home for several years. I just do it when I have some time throughout my day.</p> 
            <p>I've been doing this so successfully for a few years now that the Marketing Research companies want me to find other like-minded people who can take paid surveys at home. <b>People like you</b>. </p> 
            <img src="/img/circle-text1.jpg" style="margin: 10px 0px;" /> 
            <p>When I first started in this business I had to pay $35 for a list of paid survey companies. But YOU don't have to pay that. I'm giving you the same list for free.</p> 
            <p>Here's how it works. Fortune 500 corporations spend millions of dollars per year with Market Research companies to try to find out what their consumers really want. <b>That's where you come in</b>. The Market Research companies send you surveys that you complete online right at your computer and then pay you for your time and effort. It's very simple. </p> 
            <p>You've heard of the companies that need your opinions. Companies like Apple, Ford, Starbucks, TGI Fridays, Calvin Klein, etc. Virtually every company that sells to the public uses market research in one way or another. And you might have heard of the Market Research companies as well: Nielsen (the TV ratings people), IPSOS, NPD, Synovate, etc. We currently have over 40 Market Research companies in our members' area (you can see the top 20 <a href="/paidsurveys" target="_blank">here</a> without registering). <b>All of them want your opinions for their clients and they pay you for them</b>.</p> 
            <p>Here are some of the things you will be doing:</p> 
            <ul class="copy-list"> 
             <li>Getting paid to do online surveys for $1 to $32 per survey (depending on the length)</li> 
             <li>Getting paid from $25 to $75 per hour taking phone surveys</li> 
             <li>Earning between $37 and $110 per hour participating in focus groups</li> 
             <li>Previewing movie trailers for $4 to $25 per hour</li> 
             <li>Getting paid to try out new products (and getting to keep them when you're done)</li> 
            </ul> 
            <br /> 
            <p>Register at the top right of this page and I'll teach you the best way to get the highest paying surveys. I'll send you a complimentary email course over the next 7 days that will get you off to an amazingly fast start. Register now to see if there are paid survey opportunities in your area.</p> 
            <p>All my best!</p>

       <div id="faq"> 
        <ul id="faq-left" class="mr"> 
         <li> <h3>How do I get paid?</h3> <p>When you sign up as a panelist for survey companies, they send you surveys for your demographic (your age, gender, marital status, etc.). You fill out the surveys and then they pay you directly, either by check, PayPal or gift cards (like Amazon or Visa).</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>Why would anyone pay me for just filling out surveys?</h3> <p>Market Research companies pay out millions per year for surveys to find out what people like YOU want. You will be helping to shape the products and services companies will bring to market.</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>What's in it for you? Why would you do this?</h3> <p>We like to be 100% upfront and honest and treat people how we would want to be treated. We get paid by the marketing research firms to find panelists for them. They value your opinion enough to pay us to find YOU.</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>What are the risks to me, the survey-taker?</h3> <p>Always check the privacy policy of any &quot;marketing research&quot; company you sign up with. Many are fakes that just end up spamming you. We do not do business with any of those. Our list is safe.</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>How much can I expect to make?</h3> <p>That depends on how much you want to work. If you want to spend 20 minutes a day and make an extra $1000 a month, this isn't for you. It's going to require a greater time investment than that. Making an extra $50 to $500 is not unreasonable. Some members are making over $1000 per month but they are doing focus group work also (which we show you how to do).</p> </li> 
        </ul> 
        <ul id="faq-right" class="mr"> 
         <li> <h3>Do I have to give my credit card info to anyone?</h3> <p>No. Not to us and not to any of the Survey companies we represent. Any Marketing Research company that asks you for money is not legit. You will not find any of those companies in our list.</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>What's the catch?</h3> <p>No catch. You get a free membership to Survey Money Machine and we connect you to the best paying survey companies online. And we don't just leave you there. We train you and give you all the ins and outs of how to maximize your earnings with online surveys.</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>Will I get rich?</h3> <p>No. And anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something. You won't make millions of dollars doing this. But if you're looking for a way to make a few hundred extra a month, taking surveys at home can do that for you.</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>Will you spam me?</h3> <p>Absolutely not. We hate spam and will never spam you. We will never sell or rent your email address to anyone. We stand by our privacy policy 100%. You can read it <a onclick="window.open('/privacy_policy.php','List','menubar=no,width=500,height=700, scrollbars=yes');" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;">here</a>. (By the way, there are other free paid survey sites out there that spam you like crazy and sell your information anyone who pays them for it--please read all privacy policies before signing up at any of those sites)</p> </li> 
         <li> <h3>How do I get started?</h3> <p>Easy. Just complete the signup form at the top of the page. We will match you with market research companies that are looking for new paid panelists.</p> </li>

         <ul> 
          <li>Our service is absolutely 100% free to you. We will never charge you. Most Paid Survey companies charge for their service (<a style="color: #7F80FF; text-decoration: underline; cursor: pointer;" onclick="window.open(&quot;/list.php&quot;,&quot;List&quot;,&quot;menubar=no,width=430,height=360,toolbar=no&quot;);">see proof</a><a></a>). Why pay when you get the same information for free?</li> 
          <li>We never sell your contact information to anyone. We hate spam as much as you do and we will never spam you, <br />or help anyone else spam you.</li> 
          <li>You need to know that many websites posing as Survey companies simply blast you with &quot;offers&quot; that you end up paying for. We do not support or do business with any of those companies. And as far as we know, we are the only survey company that doesn't.</li>
