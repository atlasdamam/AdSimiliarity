Told through the eyes of the title's heroine, Maisie navigates this ever-widening turmoil with a six-year-old's innocence, charm and generosity of spirit.</p><p>An aging rock star (Moore) and a contemporary art dealer (Coogan)—Susanna and Beale are too self-involved even to notice their neglect and inadequacy as parents; their fight for Maisie is just another battle in an epic war of personalities.  As they raise the stakes by taking on inappropriate new partners, the ex-nanny Margo and the much younger bartender Lincoln (Vanderham and Skarsgård), the shuffling of Maisie from household to household becomes more and more callous, the consequences more and more troubling.  Always watchful, however, Maisie begins to understand that the path through this morass of adult childishness and selfish blindness will have to be of her own making.</p><p>Directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel, written by Carroll Cartwright and Nancy Doyne, and from the producers of The Kids Are All Right, WHAT MAISIE KNEW is a heartbreaking but redemptive story of family, self-sacrifice, and the indelibility of one child's love, starring Julianne Moore, Alexander Skarsgård, Steve Coogan and Joanna Vanderham, introducing Onata Aprile as "Maisie."</p></div></div></div><!--//synopsis-pane-->

									Internationally lauded cinematographer Giles Nuttgens is known for his attention to emotional detail across a breadth of cinematic endeavors. </p><p>Nuttgens’ extensive feature resume includes Deepa Mehta’s elemental triology Fire, Earth and Water. Water received a 2007 Oscar® nomination for Best Foreign Language Film and earned Nuttgens the 2006 GENIE Award for Best Cinematography.  Earlier in 2011, he reteamed with Mehta to shoot the upcoming Midnight’s Children, based on the bestselling Salman Rushdie novel. Midnight’s Children will also premiere at the 2012’s TIFF.</p><p>In 2007, Nuttgens’ “sigh-inducingly evocative” (the Telegraph) cinematography for Mister Foe earned Best Cinematography awards at the Copenhagen Film Festival and British Film Festival in Dinard, as well as a Best Cinematography nomination at the 2008 Evening Standard Awards.  Prior to Mister Foe, Nuttgens shot writer/director Jake Paltrow’s The Goodnight, starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Penélope Cruz, Simon Pegg and Danny DeVito. Often building strong relationships with directors, Nuttgens first worked with McGehee and Siegel on The Deep End, a film which earned Nuttgens the 2001 Sundance Film Festival Award for Best Cinematography and a nomination in the same category at the 2002 Independent Spirit Awards. He collaborated with the directors again on 2005’s Bee Season, starring Richard Gere and Juliette Binoche. Nuttgens also formed a lasting relationship with Lucasfilm, working on Star Wars episodes 1, 2 and 3, subsequently earning an expertise in digital effects.</p><p>Despite his experience with FX, all of Nuttgens’ work is grounded in an understanding of the psychological landscape of cinematic narrative. “Beautiful images are not enough,” says Nuttgens. “The images have to be acutely linked with the emotional substrata of any text. While this may seem obvious in theory, the notion often gets lost in the high pressure process of film-making.”</p><p>BBC trained, Nuttgens rose through the camera department on a variety of dramas, documentaries and news programs. He was one of the youngest cameramen ever to be appointed to the BBC. His work during these early years involved a significant amount of international travel. Nuttgens remembers an exceptional experience in his early career, “Spending four months in the Brazilian jungle sleeping on the sandbanks on the side of the Araguaia River and living off dried manioc flour and the red-bellied amazonian piraña that we fished every day. The BBC at that time was a place where a crew would just disappear for months on end in the remotest parts of the world, never having to, or being able to report back to the producers in the U.K. until the shooting was over and the exposed film was flying back across the world to the laboratories in England. It was a time of great creative freedom.” These formative experiences paved the way to a future career in Hollywood.</p><p><b>RED CROWN PRODUCTIONS (Production Company)</b><br>
									Red Crown Productions (RCP) was formed in June 2010 by Daniel Crown and Daniela Taplin Lundberg.
