October 4, 5 &amp; 6 Tucson, Arizona</p>
<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>Very possibly the most important <em>Casey Research Summit</em> ever has been scheduled at the stunning <em>Loews Ventana Canyon Resort</em> in Tucson, Arizona, this October 4, 5 and 6.</p>

			<div class="shadow-peel  print-float-right">
			<img src="http://d1w116sruyx1mf.cloudfront.net/sites/2013-fall-summit/images/Loews.jpg" alt="Loews Ventana Canyon, Tucson">

			<p class="clearblock" style="margin:10px; height:12px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over three information-packed days, a limited number of Casey Research readers and guests will participate side by side with a blue-ribbon faculty led by <strong>Dr. Ron Paul</strong> as they explore the <em>seismic</em> shifts ahead for the large Western economies and investment markets.</p>
<p>The world we now live in is manipulated, managed, and controlled… by the very same people who have manipulated, managed, and controlled the global economy to the precipice.</p>
<p>Separating fact from fiction is <em>essential</em> to surviving what's coming with your assets intact.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Will Obamacare destroy the US health care system and cripple the economy?</li>
<li>Can the world's central banks really print their economies back to prosperity?</li>
<li>What's driving the US stock market? How big is the risk as it reaches new highs?</li>
<li>Is the bond bubble approaching a pin, wiping out bond investors while simultaneously opening a decades-long profit opportunity for early movers?</li>
<li>Is the bull market in hard assets over or just getting started? What's holding gold and silver stocks back?</li>
<li>Has the US now crossed the line in becoming a police state?</li>
<li>After decades of false promises, is America finally on the path to energy independence? Or is it a myth opening the door for clear-eyed energy investors to profit?</li>
<li>Just how far is your government willing to go to defend the status quo of deficit spending and to keep the social fabric from tearing?</li>
<li>Is a currency war now both inevitable and imminent… what are the consequences for investors?</li>
<li>Is the Eurozone doomed?</li>
<li>And that's just for starters…</li>
</ul>
<p>As you don't need us to tell you, the world has left the proverbial tracks, with overreaching governments now pursuing "whatever it takes" policies in the attempt to force fundamentally damaged economies into recovery, thereby creating massive misallocations of capital and investment pitfalls around every corner.</p>
<p>The government-led bank heist in Cyprus was just part of a continuum that, as it unfolds, will increasingly penalize the successful, destroy the middle class with inflation, and trap your wealth inside national borders in order to tax it at higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>To help you fully understand the perilous new world we live in and how to prepare for what’s next, Casey Research has pulled out all the stops for its only Summit to be held in 2013. Starting with an exceptional faculty, most of whom will not only present their latest research and answer your questions but participate as audience members throughout the entire three-day event.</p>

				<h4 class="spkname highlight">Dr. Ron Paul</h4>
				<p class="job-title">Former Congressman and US Presidential Candidate</p>
<p>Former Congressman Ron Paul of Texas is the leading spokesman for limited constitutional government, low taxes, free markets, and a return to sound monetary policies based on commodity-backed currency.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul was known for his consistent voting record in the House of Representatives, never voting for legislation unless the proposed measure was expressly authorized by the Constitution. In the words of former Treasury Secretary William Simon, Dr. Paul is the "one exception to the Gang of 535" on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>He has served on the House Banking Committee, where he was a strong advocate for sound monetary policy and an outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve's inflationary measures. He also was a key member of the Gold Commission, advocating a return to a gold standard.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul will present the keynote address at the Casey Research Summit and attend the entire event as an audience member.</p>

<p>Louis James’ background in physics, economics, and technical writing prepared him well for his role as senior editor of the <em>International Speculator</em> and <em>Casey Investment Alert</em>. Like Doug Casey, Louis constantly travels the world, visiting highly prospective geological targets, grilling management and company geologists and interviewing natives in a variety of languages to find out what they really think (he’s fluent in French and Spanish, and speaks a little German and Russian). Whether it’s days of back-to-back meetings with mining company executives in Vancouver, pounding on rocks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, examining drill cores in Argentina, or eating food with names he can’t pronounce with local miners in China, Louis is constantly looking for the next double-your-money winner. He evaluates dozens of companies every month, conducts due diligence on the best, and then compares notes with Doug in order to bring only those most likely to provide rapid high returns to his subscribers’ attention. Louis also reads all the press releases, financial statements, and an enormous quantity of related information to keep track of all of our mineral companies, and has become something of a walking database on the same.
