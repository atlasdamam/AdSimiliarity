			<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cohort.com.au/">Cohort Digital</a> ABN 13 562 062 502 is an Australian company aiming to bring you some of the best offers, discounts  and competitions on the Internet. All of the offers have been chosen  specifically to benefit you by giving you something fun, useful, entertaining  or just downright cheaper than usual! All we ask is that you complete a sign-up  survey so that we can bring you further offers, either by email, mail or phone,  which match your lifestyle. The information you give us in the survey will help  us to choose the offers and competitions which most closely match your  interests, so the more you can tell us, the more relevant your offers will be.</p>
				<p>We also run prize  draws, many of which are exclusive to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cohort.com.au/">Cohort Digital</a> and provided by our clients. Each time you complete a short sponsored question at the website and  answer the relevant questions, you'll be entered into the corresponding prize  draw. Our clients ask these questions to help them understand what kinds of  products and services Australian consumers would like to see. This may be  information ranging from what kind of holiday breaks you enjoy right through to  whether you've recently bought a new car. By collecting your answers, and those  of other Australian consumers, we help clients bring new products onto the  market which will match your requirements, or to improve existing products.</p>
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cohort.com.au/">Cohort Digital</a> is a permission-based marketing organisation, working with major high-street  and online brand names to bring you offers, information and competitions. All  our clients are reputable companies and any email you receive from us will  carry a clear statement of origination (saying it's from us, using the  information you provided when you signed up) and the option to unsubscribe from  any further emails.</p>
				<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cohort.com.au/">Cohort Digital</a> can be contacted at PO Box 369, Strawberry Hills, NSW, 2012.</p>
