					registration form. You will be asked to provide basic contact information, including your name, age, zip code, email address and/or telephone number. Entrants must 
					be the registered subscriber of the email account from which the entry is made. 
				</p>
				<p>
					One entry per valid email address will be entered into the Sweepstakes. Although subsequent attempts to enter may be received, only entrant's first entry during the 
					specified Sweepstakes entry period will count. No third party entry or entry through sweepstakes service permitted. All entries become the property of the Administrator 
					and none will be acknowledged or returned. Any individual who attempts or otherwise encourages, directly or indirectly, the entry of multiple or false contact 
					information under multiple identities, or uses any device or artifice to enter or encourage, directly or indirectly, multiple or false entries, as determined by the 
					Administrator, will be disqualified. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If, in the Administrator's opinion, there is any suspected or actual evidence of electronic or non-electronic tampering with any portion of the Sweepstakes, or if 
					a computer virus, bug, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical difficulties, or failures compromise or corrupt or affect the administration, integrity, security, 
					fairness, or proper conduct of the Sweepstakes, and/or the Sweepstakes is not capable of being conducted as described in these Official Rules, Sweepstakes Entities 
					shall have the right, at their sole discretion, to disqualify any individual who tampers with the entry process and to void any entries submitted fraudulently, and/or 
					to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend this Sweepstakes, and conduct a random drawing to select the prize winners from all non-suspect entries received prior to 
					action taken, or as otherwise deemed fair and appropriate by Sweepstakes Entities. Sweepstakes Entities reserve the right to prosecute any fraudulent entries to the 
					fullest extent of the law. 
				</p>
				<p>
					ELIGIBILITY: The Sweepstakes is open only to natural persons who are legal residents of the United States of America or Canada (except Quebec), who are at least 
					eighteen (18) years of age at the time of entry. Sweepstakes may only be entered from and in eligible jurisdictions. Sweepstakes Entities and each of their respective 
					parent companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, assigns, agents, representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, and employees, and any entity involved in

					and/or those persons living in the same household of such individuals, are not eligible to participate. In the event of a dispute about the identity of an entrant, 
					each entry will be declared made by the registered account holder of the e-mail address submitted at time of entry. The registered account holder is deemed to be the 
					natural person who is assigned the submitted e-mail address by the relevant Internet service provider, online access provider or other organization (e.g., business, 
					educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address. With respect to any 
					winning entry, the winner may be required to provide Administrator with proof that the person is the registered account holder of the e-mail address associated with the 
					winning entry. By entering the Sweepstakes, entrants agree to comply with and be bound by these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sweepstakes Entities which are 
					final and binding in all respects. Failure to comply with these Official Rules may result in disqualification from the Sweepstakes.

					Entities into disrepute.
				</p>
				<p>
					There will be only one prize per winner. Lost or stolen prizes will not be replaced. Prize does not include any other item or expense not specifically described in 
					these Official Rules, and all additional expenses including, without limitation, travel expenses, if any, are the sole responsibility of winner. Prizes may not be 
					transferred or assigned except to a surviving spouse living in the same household. Only listed prizes will be awarded and no substitutions or cash equivalents or 
					redemption will be made, except that Administrator reserves the right to award a prize of equal or greater financial value if any advertised prize (or any component 
					thereof) becomes unavailable. Prize cannot be used in conjunction with any other promotion or offer. Winners agree to accept the prize "as is", and entrants hereby 
					acknowledge that Sweepstakes Entities have neither made nor are in any manner responsible or liable for any warranty, representation, or guarantee, express or implied, 
					in fact or in law, relative to the prize, including express warranties (if any) provided exclusively by a prize supplier that are sent along with the prize. 
				</p>
				<p>

					for value of prize $600 or more. Prizes are not transferable, redeemable for cash or exchangeable for any other prize.
				</p>
				<p>
					SELECTION OF WINNERS: Winners will be selected on or about May 7, 2013, in a random drawing from among all eligible entries received. The drawing will be conducted by 
					Administrator, whose decisions and interpretations on all matters relating to the Sweepstakes and these Official Rules are final and binding in all respects. Administrator 
					reserves the right to disqualify any participant or winner and may refuse to award any prize to a person who is ineligible or has violated any rule, gained unfair advantage 
					in participating in the Sweepstakes, or obtained winner status using fraudulent means. All potential winners are subject to verification by Administrator. An entrant is 
					not a winner of any prize, even if the Sweepstakes should so indicate, unless and until entrant's eligibility has been verified and entrant has been notified that 
					verification is complete. Administrator will not accept screen shots or other evidence of winning in lieu of its validation process. Any play that occurs after the 
					system has failed for any reason is deemed a defective play and is void and will not be honored.
				</p>
				<p>
					Odds of winning a prize depend on the number of eligible entries received. Potential winners will be notified by telephone and/or e-mail and must meet all eligibility 
					requirements. Return of a prize or prize notification as undeliverable, or inability of Administrator to contact a potential winner by telephone or e-mail within seventy-two 
					(72) hours of selection, may result in disqualification of such potential winner, and an alternate winner may be selected by random drawing at Administrator's discretion.
					In the event a winner declines a prize, Administrator may, at its discretion, select an alternate winner by random drawing. In such case, up to three (3) alternate drawings may be held, time permitting, after which the applicable prize will remain unawarded. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If a potential winner is a Canadian resident, upon notification, the selected entrant, must, unaided, correctly answer a time-limited mathematical skill-testing question. 
					In the event that a selected entrant is unable to answer the skill-testing question correctly, the Administrator shall have the right to disqualify said entrant and to randomly 
					draw another eligible entry, and the Administrator shall be fully and completely released and discharged from any liability or responsibility in this regard.
				</p>
				<p>
					PUBLICITY, PRIVACY &amp; PRIZE NOTIFICATION: Except where prohibited by law or regulation, by submitting an entry, entrant grants the Administrator a perpetual, worldwide, 
					royalty-free license to use his/her name, character, photograph, voice, and likeness in connection with the promotion of this and other Sweepstakes, and entrants waive any 
					and all claims and/or rights to receive any royalties or other compensation for the Administrator's use thereof, unless prohibited by law. Entry into this Sweepstakes may 
					require entrant to enter its email address and certain other personal information. Entrants are informed that the personal data collection in connection with this Sweepstakes 
					will be collected by Administrator's servers and computer systems, which are based in the United States and such collection will therefore be subject to applicable United 
					States laws. You may withdraw your personal data upon request; however, you will be disqualified as an entrant in this Sweepstakes if you withdraw your personal data prior to 
					the determination of the winner(s) and fulfillment of the prize(s). Entrants agree that, if entrant opts in, the Administrator may use personal data for marketing purposes. 
					Winners may be required to complete, sign, notarize and return an affidavit of eligibility/liability release and a publicity release, which must be returned, properly executed, 
					within three (3) days of issuance of prize notification. If the winner is under eighteen (18) years of age, the affidavit of eligibility/liability release and publicity release 
					must be executed by the winner and one or both parents or legal guardians, depending upon the state of residence of the winner. If these documents are not returned properly 
					executed, or are returned to Administrator as undeliverable, or if any given prize winner does not otherwise comply with the Officials Rules, the prize will be forfeited and 
					awarded to an alternate winner. 
				</p>
				<p>
					GENERAL CONDITIONS/RELEASE: The Sweepstakes is void where prohibited by law and is governed by the laws of the United States of America. The submission of an entry is solely 
					the responsibility of the entrant. Only eligible entries actually received by 11:59 PM PT on May 5, 2013, during the specified Sweepstakes entry period, will be included in 
					the prize drawing. Any automated receipt (such as one confirming delivery of text message or e-mail) does not constitute proof of actual receipt by Administrator of an entry 
					for purposes of these Official Rules. By participating, entrants (a) release Sweepstakes Entities, and each of their respective parent companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, 
					successors, assigns, agents, representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, and employees, from any and all liability for any claims, costs, injuries, losses or damages 
					of any kind caused by participation in the Sweepstakes, including the unauthorized or illegal access to personally identifiable or sensitive information or acceptance, possession, 
					use, misuse, or nonuse of the prize that may be awarded; and (b) acknowledge that said parties have neither made nor are in any manner responsible or liable for any warranty, 
					representation or guarantee, expressed or implied, in fact or in law, relative to a prize including, without limitation, the prize quality or availability. Neither Sweepstakes 
					Entities nor any service providers are responsible for incorrect or inaccurate transcription of Entry information, or for any human or other error, technical malfunctions, 
					lost/delayed data or voice transmission, omission, interruption, deletion, defect, line failures of any telephone network, computer equipment, software, inability to access 
					any online service or Website or to complete a telephone call or facsimile transaction, or any other error or malfunction, or late, lost or misdirected mail, or any injury or 
					damage to participant's or any other person's computer or television related to or resulting from participation in this Sweepstakes. CAUTION: ANY ATTEMPT BY AN ENTRANT OR ANY 
					OTHER INDIVIDUAL TO DELIBERATELY DAMAGE ANY WEBSITE, TAMPER WITH THE ENTRY PROCESS, OR OTHERWISE UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THE SWEEPSTAKES MAY BE A VIOLATION OF 
					CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LAWS AND SHOULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE MADE, SPONSOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO COOPERATE IN THE PROSECUTION OF ANY SUCH INDIVIDUAL(S) AND TO PURSUE ALL REMEDIES TO 
					THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. Sweepstakes Entities' failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. 
				</p>
				<p>
					DISPUTES: Entrants and guests agree that (a) any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of, or connected with, the Sweepstakes for prize awarded shall be 
					resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by the United States District Court for the Central District of California or the appropriate 
					California State Court located in Los Angeles County, California; (b) any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket costs incurred, including 
					costs associated with entering this Sweepstakes but in no event attorneys' fees; and (c) under no circumstances will entrant be permitted to obtain awards for, and entrant hereby 
					waives all rights to, claim punitive, incidental and consequential damages and any other damages, other than out-of-pocket expenses, and any and all rights to have damages 
					multiplied or otherwise increased. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY 
					TO YOU. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, entrant's rights and obligations, or the rights 
					and obligations of the Sweepstakes Entities in connection with the Sweepstakes, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of State of California, without 
					giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any 
					jurisdiction other than State of California.
