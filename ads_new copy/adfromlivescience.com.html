<p>Here is a review of some of the findings by archaeologists concerning farming:
</p><p></p><hr width="60%"><p>
</p><p>"The great majority of the cultivated plants of the world trace their origin 
  to Asia. Out of 640 important cultivated plants, about 500 originated in 
  Southern Asia. In Asia alone we have established five of the principle regions 
  of cultivated plants.... The fifth region of origin in Asia is the 
  Southwestern Asiatic centre and includes Asia Minor, Trans-Caucasia, Iran and 
  Western Turkmenistan. This region is remarkable, first of all, for its 
  richness in numbers of species of wheat resistant to different 
  diseases...There is no doubt that Armenia is the chief home of cultivated 
  wheat. Asia Minor and Trans-Caucasia gave origin to rye which is represented 
  here by a great number of varieties and species....</p>
  <p>Our studies show definitely that Asia is not only the home of the majority 
  of modern cultivated plants, but also of our chief domesticated animals such 
  as the cow, the yak, the buffalo, sheep, goat, horse, and pig...The 
  chief home of the cow and other cattle, the Oriental type of horse, the goat 
  and the sheep is specifically Iran....</p>
  <p>As the result of a brilliant work of Dr. Sinskaya, the discovery was 
  recently made that the home of alfalfa, the world's most important forage 
  crop, is located in Trans-Caucasia and Iran....</p>
  <p>From all these definitely established facts the importance of Asia as the 
  primary home of the greatest majority of cultivated plants and domesticated 
  animals is quite clear."</p>
(Vavilov, N. , "Asia: Source of Species" in <i>Asia, </i>February 1937, 
p. 113. )

<p>More recent studies conducted by Melinda A Zeder and Brian Hesse (Science
287 (2000) 2254-57) place the initial domestication of goats to the Zargos
Mountains at about 10,000 years ago. In more recent studies they have adjusted
the dates slightly and now place domestication of sheep and goats at 11,000 years ago, 
pigs at 10,500, and cattle at 10,000. "The earlier dates mean that animals were 
domesticated at much the same time as crop plants, and bear on the issue of how 
this ensemble of new agricultural species ? the farming package known as the 
Neolithic revolution ? spread from the Near East to Europe."
And Manfred Heun's (Science 278 (1997) 1312-14) 
studies indicate that large scale wheat cultivation began from 8,000 to 9,000 years
ago near the Karacadag Mountains.  Both areas are very near where the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers come close together. 

</p><p>
"The cradle of agriculture generally has been placed in the Jordan Valley of the
 southern Levant (today's Israel and Jordan). But work by Simcha Lev-Yadun of 
 Israel's Agricultural Research Organization and colleagues suggest the first 
 farms may have been farther north, between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in 
 what is today northeastern Turkey and northern Syria.</p><p>
<u>Wild progenitors of the main Neolithic founder crops (einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, 
barley, lentil, pea, chickpea, bitter vetch, and flax) are found together only 
in this small core area of the Fertile Crescent.</u></p><p>
Lev-Yadun reports that wild chickpea especially is extremely rare, yet it was a 
staple crop of Neolithic life 10,000 years ago. Agriculture, therefore, probably 
began in an area where chickpea is native. Archaeological evidence shows that the 
earliest known farming settlements of the Fertile Crescent were in this core area.
Also, the limited genetic variability of these crops implies that they were 
<u>domesticated only once</u> ? rather than by several different cultures at roughly 
the same time. Evidence of domesticated crops in the core area dates to about 
10,000 years ago, while the earliest signs of farming elsewhere are about 9,300 
years ago.</p><p>
Neolithic sites discovered in the core area indicate that a society with plenty 
of food thrived there. In sites such as Cayonu, Novali Cori, and Gobekli Tepe, 
impressive architecture, images, and artifacts have been found. <u>Settlement sites 
are also larger in this area than many others of the same time in other parts 
of the Fertile Crescent.</u> ..." (From "<b>The Cradle of Agriculture? New Evidence 
Moves the World's First Farmers into Turkey</b>" by Reagan Duplisea,

<p>"It is known that agriculture spread from the Middle East to Europe during the 
Neolithic period about 12,000 years ago, but for many years archeologists have 
debated how this occurred. Was it due to the movement of people or to the movement 
of ideas? Previous genetic analysis of people living today suggests a

The latest study reinforces evidence of a migration in which people brought

<p>Looking at the Greenland ice core data and Lake Van varve data as follows. </p></font></font></blockquote><font face="arial, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000000">

</center><br><blockquote>(note: the gray band shifts show "a time difference of 570 (GRIP) or 730 (GISP2) years between the Late Pleistocene chronozones" for the varve data." and "At around 10,500 yr B. P. (this date also has a time shift error) a conspicious layer, consisting of 7-10 dark brown, thick varves ..., was deposited in Lake Van. Biomarker analyses of this organic carbon rich layer ... showed, that the lipid fraction consist mainly of longchain alkenones ... The author concludes that Prymnesiophyceae were the primary producers and suggests that <b>a mixing event</b>, following a long time of stagnation, led to the enrichment of nutrients in the lake water." (from Palaeo 122(1996)p.115))


<p>We see a brief warm period from about 15,000 to 14,000 years ago, followed
by a cooling period and then the even greater cooling of the Younger-Dryas period 
from about 13,500 to 12,000 years ago. Now what would greatly increase the toil
of a group of <b>farmers</b> more than a period of severe climate?  So it would seem
that one could conjecture that the period of the garden of Eden was the relatively warm
period of about 15,000 to 14,000 years ago when Adam started farming and then 
this was followed
by the cool period of from 14,000 years ago to about 12,000, <b>"the
curse of the ground"</b> a period in which farming was more difficult.  Then about
12,000 years ago the warming up begins and farming becomes easier and proliferates.


</p><p></p><h3>How about the location?</h3>
<p>As already shown the data on the farmers indicates that the after the flood
Genesis history took place in the Ararat area and that the area is also the origin of
many of the known farm crops and domesticated animals. Also all four of the rivers 
of Eden listed in Genesis 2:11-14 can be readily identified, the

<a href="" name="back2"></a>
<b>"Perath, Hiddekel, Gihon and Pishon"</b> </p><blockquote><p> "Perath is simply the Hebrew version of 
      Arabic Firat and Greek Euphrates; </p><p> "Hiddekel is Hebrew for 
      Sumerian Idiglat from which the Greek Tigris derives."</p><p> 
      Gihon; "... the River Aras, flowing into the Caspian Sea from the 
      mountains north of Lake Urmia, was once called the Gaihun. By checking the 
      writings of the Islamic geographers who accompanied the Arabic invasion of 
      Persia in the 8th century, I was able to confirm that this was indeed the 
      case. Moreover, even as late as the last century, Victorian atlases and 
      encyclopaedias were still naming the river as the Gaihun-Aras. The Gaihun 
      is therefore the missing biblical Gihon."</p><p>
      "Pishon - "Hebrew (West Semitic) name derived from the old 
      Iranian Uizhun, where the Iranian vowel 'U' had been converted into the 
      Semitic labial consonant 'P'. Thus we have Uizhun to Pizhun to Pishon. 
      Strange as it may seem, such switches do occur between the two language 
      groups. For instance, one archaeological site in Iran is known by its 
      Arabic (West Semitic) name of Pisdeli whereas its ancient (Iranian) name 
      was Uishteri. The river Uizhun (the modern Qezel Uzun) - thus identified 
      as the biblical Pishon - flows down from the mountains of Kurdistan and 
      empties into the southern basin of the Caspian Sea."

<p>All people are related, but "In the article in the November 2001 issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics, 
Ariella Oppenheim of the Hebrew University of Israel wrote that this new study 
revealed that <u>Jews have a closer genetic relationship to populations in the 
northern Mediterranean (Kurds, Anatolian Turks, and Armenians)</u> than to populations 
in the southern Mediterranean (Arabs and Bedouins)." (from http://www.barzan.com/ kevin_brook.htm)



</p><p></p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p></p>
<p>We have summarized some of the data that seems to indicate that there was a 
cultural shift for humans that was brought on by the development of the
farming society possibly allowed by the ASPM gene variant as early as
14,000 years ago.  By examining the available archaeological data on the development
of this farming community and comparing it to the Biblical Genesis description of
Adam and his descendants we have attempted to demonstrate how this data provides
us with an approximate time line for the Biblical Adam, the first man by Biblical definition,
a <b>farmer</b>. Thus by <b>farming</b> man demonstrates his ability to;

<p>The human brain may still be evolving. So suggests new research that
tracked changes in two genes thought to help regulate brain growth,
changes that appeared well after the rise of modern humans 200,000
years ago.</p>
<p>That the defining feature of humans — our large brains — continued
to evolve as recently as 5,800 years ago, and may be doing so today,
promises to surprise the average person, if not biologists.</p>
<p>"We, including scientists, have considered ourselves as sort of the
pinnacle of evolution," noted lead researcher Bruce Lahn, a University
of Chicago geneticist whose studies appear in Friday's edition of the
journal Science.</p>
<p>"There's a sense we as humans have kind of peaked," agreed Greg
Wray, director of Duke University's Center for Evolutionary Genomics.
"A different way to look at is it's almost impossible for evolution not
to happen."</p>
<p>Still, the findings also are controversial, because it's far from
clear what effect the genetic changes had or if they arose when Lahn's
"molecular clock" suggests — at roughly the same time period as some
cultural achievements, including written language and the development
of cities.</p>
<p>Lahn and colleagues examined two genes, named microcephalin and
ASPM, that are connected to brain size. If those genes don't work,
babies are born with severely small brains, called microcephaly.</p>
<p>Using DNA samples from ethnically diverse populations, they
identified a collection of variations in each gene that occurred with
unusually high frequency. In fact, the variations were so common they
couldn't be accidental mutations but instead were probably due to
natural selection, where genetic changes that are favorable to a
species quickly gain a foothold and begin to spread, the researchers
report.</p>
<p>Lahn offers an analogy: Medieval monks would copy manuscripts and
each copy would inevitably contain errors — accidental mutations. Years
later, a ruler declares one of those copies the definitive manuscript,
and a rush is on to make many copies of that version — so whatever
changes from the original are in this presumed important copy become
widely disseminated.</p>
<p>Scientists attempt to date genetic changes by tracing back to such
spread, using a statistical model that assumes genes have a certain
mutation rate over time.</p>
<p>For the microcephalin gene, the variation arose about 37,000 years
ago, about the time period when art, music and tool-making were
emerging, Lahn said. For ASPM, the variation arose about 5,800 years
ago, roughly correlating with the development of written language,
spread of agriculture and development of cities, he said.</p>
<p>"The genetic evolution of humans in the very recent past might in some ways be linked to the cultural evolution," he said.</p>
<p>Other scientists urge great caution in interpreting the research.</p>
<p>That the genetic changes have anything to do with brain size or
intelligence "is totally unproven and potentially dangerous territory
to get into with such sketchy data," stressed Dr. Francis Collins,
director of the National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>
<p>Aside from not knowing what the gene variants actually do, no one
knows how precise the model Lahn used to date them is, Collins added.</p>
<p>Lahn's own calculations acknowledge that the microcephalin variant
could have arisen anywhere from 14,000 to 60,000 years ago, and that
the uncertainty about the ASPM variant ranged from 500 to 14,000 years
ago.</p>
<p>Those criticisms are particularly important, Collins said, because
Lahn's testing did find geographic differences in populations harboring
the gene variants today. They were less common in sub-Saharan African
populations, for example.</p>
<p>That does not mean one population is smarter than another, Lahn and
other scientists stressed, noting that numerous other genes are key to
brain development.</p>
<p>"There's just no correlation," said Duke's Wray, calling education
and other environmental factors more important for intelligence than
DNA anyway.

            <p>A family tree of Indo-European languages suggests they began to 
            spread and split about 9,000 years ago. The finding hints that 
            farmers in what is now Turkey drove the language boom - and not 
            later Siberian horsemen, as some linguists reckon.</p>
            <p>Russell Gray and Quentin Atkinson, of the University of Auckland 
            in New Zealand use the rate at which words change to gauge the age 
            of the tree's roots - just as biologists estimate a species' age 
            from the rate of gene mutations. The differences between words, or 
            DNA sequences, are a measure of how closely languages, or species, 
            are related.</p>
            <p>Gray and Atkinson analysed 87 languages from Irish to Afghan. 
            Rather than compare entire dictionaries, they used a list of 200 
            words that are found in all cultures, such as 'I', 'hunt' and 'sky'. 
            Words are better understood than grammar as a guide to language 
            history; the same sentence structure can arise independently in 
            different tongues.</p>
            <p>The resulting tree matches many existing ideas about language 
            development. Spanish and Portuguese come out as sisters, for example 
            - both are cousins to German, and Hindi is a more distant relation 
            to all three.</p>
            <p>All other Indo-European languages split off from Hittite, the 
            oldest recorded member of the group, between 8,000 and 10,000 years 
            ago, the pair calculates<a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/nsu_pf/031124/031124-6.html#b1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
            <p>Around this time, farming techniques began to spread out of 
            Anatolia - now Turkey - across Europe and Asia, archaeological 
            evidence shows. The farmers themselves may have moved, or natives 
            may have adopted words along with agricultural technology.</p>
            <p>The conclusion will be controversial, as there is no consensus on 
            where Indo-European languages came from. Some linguists believe that 
            Kurgan horsemen carried them out of central Asia 6,000 years ago. 
            "No matter how we [changed] the analysis or assumptions, we couldn't 
            get a date of around 6,000 years," says Gray.</p>
            <p>"This kind of study is exactly what linguistics needs," says 
            April McMahon, who studies the history of languages at the 
            University of Sheffield, UK. It shows how ideas about language 
            evolution can be tested, she says: "Linguists have always been good 
            at coming up with bold hypotheses, but they haven't been terribly 
            good at testing them."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But the technique is still fraught with difficulties, McMahon 
            warns. There is lots of word-swapping within language groups. 
            English took 'skirt' from the Vikings, for example, but 'shirt' is 
            original. Linguists must separate the shared from the swapped, as 
            any error will affect later studies. </p>
            <p>The Kurgan might not be out of the picture entirely, says McMahon 
            - they may have triggered a later wave of languages. "This isn't 
            going to knock the debate on the head," she says.</p>
            <p>Biology and linguistics can learn a lot from each other, comments 
            geneticist David Searls of GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, based in 
            King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. "There may be some fundamental 
            principles of evolution of complex systems, such as languages and 
            organisms," he says.</p></blockquote></td></tr>

      <h4>The snow-covered dome of the Mountain of God, shrouded in billowing 
      clouds, towered above the old Mongol village known locally as 'the 
      honeycomb'. Earlier that morning I had set out on a pilgrimage to the 
      Exalted Throne of Yahweh where Adam's god dwelt. Within an hour the noise 
      and chaos of Tabriz had been left far behind, as our four-wheel drive 
      ascended out of the alpine valley of the Adji Chay onto the plateau of the 
      Sahand massif, with imposing volcano at its heart. Now I found myself at 
      the entrance to one of our world's most extraordinary places - the 
      troglodyte village of Kandovan.</h4></div>
      <h4>Ambling down the cobbled street - only just wide enough to take a 
      donkey and cart - I turned up a steep side alley, all the time stalked by 
      a clutch of free-roaming chickens. The alley soon morphed into a roughly 
      sculpted flight of steps which twisted and turned between huge canine 
      teeth of lava. Each was a home - a dwelling from a bygone age with rickety 
      wooden door and tiny mullioned windows. In this Dysneyesque landscape of 
      cave-dwellers, I almost expected Pinocchio to appear around the next 
      bend.</h4>

      <h4>My long journey, starting in the research libraries of London 
      University, had led me to the Mesopotamian flood plain and on up into the 
      mountains of Kurdistan, finally to reach the place the Book of Genesis 
      calls the Garden of Eden.</h4>
      <h4>There is no straightforward way to explain how an Egyptologist, used 
      to working in the dry heat of the north African deserts, should end up 
      traversing the Zagros mountains of western Iran in search of the earthly 
      paradise. I had begun my studies in the Departments of Egyptology and 
      Ancient History at University College, London, with a major interest in 
      the complex chronology of Egyptian civilisation. My PhD work to radically 
      revise that chronology had inevitably drawn me into the world of biblical 
      history - so closely bound up with the land of the pharaohs. Years of 
      research had led me to the conclusion that many of the stories in the Old 
      Testament were based on real historical events: the Israelite sojourn in 
      Egypt, the Exodus, the conquest of the Promised Land - all were attestable 
      within the archaeological record once the correct chronology had been 
      applied.</h4>
      <h4>But why was I now delving into the Book of Genesis - that most 
      mythological and hoary of the biblical texts? Surely it would have been 
      better to leave well alone? But that is not my way. The simple fact is 
      that ancient stories and legends have always fascinated me and the chance 
      to uncover the historical reality behind the greatest legend of them all 
      was just too tempting an opportunity to pass by.</h4>

      <h4>Back in 1987 I had been sent a short, privately published paper by 
      amateur historian, Reginald Walker (1917-1989), which proposed a location 
      for the Garden of Eden in north-western Iran. The main thrust of Walker's 
      argument was that the four rivers of Eden, described in Chapter Two of 
      Genesis, were to be found in that region. All four had their sources (the 
      Bible refers to them as 'heads') around the two great salt lakes of Van 
      and Urmia.</h4>
      <h4>Ever since the time of the Jewish historian Josephus, a near 
      contemporary of Christ, scholars have tried to use Genesis 2 to locate 
      Eden. But the problem has always been the identification of the rivers 
      themselves. The Bible calls them Perath, Hiddekel, Gihon and Pishon. The 
      first two are no problem: the Perath is simply the Hebrew version of 
      Arabic Firat and Greek Euphrates; similarly the Hiddekel is Hebrew for 
      Sumerian Idiglat from which the Greek Tigris derives. The remaining two 
      rivers, however, have always been a mystery. Clearly, in order to locate 
      Eden precisely, we need to find the sources of all four - and that's where 
      Walker's research comes in.</h4>
      <h4>He showed that the River Aras, flowing into the Caspian Sea from the 
      mountains north of Lake Urmia, was once called the Gaihun. By checking the 
      writings of the Islamic geographers who accompanied the Arabic invasion of 
      Persia in the 8th century, I was able to confirm that this was indeed the 
      case. Moreover, even as late as the last century, Victorian atlases and 
      encyclopaedias were still naming the river as the Gaihun-Aras. The Gaihun 
      is therefore the missing biblical Gihon.</h4>
      <h4>The fourth river - the Pishon - was more difficult to find. Walker 
      suggested that this Hebrew (West Semitic) name derived from the old 
      Iranian Uizhun, where the Iranian vowel 'U' had been converted into the 
      Semitic labial consonant 'P'. Thus we have Uizhun to Pizhun to Pishon. 
      Strange as it may seem, such switches do occur between the two language 
      groups. For instance, one archaeological site in Iran is known by its 
      Arabic (West Semitic) name of Pisdeli whereas its ancient (Iranian) name 
      was Uishteri. The river Uizhun (the modern Qezel Uzun) - thus identified 
      as the biblical Pishon - flows down from the mountains of Kurdistan and 
      empties into the southern basin of the Caspian Sea.</h4>

      <h4><i>The four rivers of Eden.</i></h4></center>
      <h4>Bringing all this together we find that the sources of all four rivers 
      originate in the highland area which Alexander the Great knew as Armenia 
      and we know today as eastern Turkey and western Iran.</h4>

      <h4>An extra-biblical Sumerian epic known as 'Enmerkar and the Lord of 
      Aratta' relates the tale of a journey made by the envoy of Enmerkar, King 
      of Uruk, from his home city in southern Mesopotamia, through the seven 
      high passes of the Zagros range and down into the magical kingdom of 
      Aratta - the 'Eldorado' of the ancient world. Enmerkar was the second 
      ruler of Uruk after the Flood, according to the Sumerian King List. A 
      crucial line in the epic describes the envoy descending from the last of 
      the seven mountain passes (the Sumerians called them 'gates') and crossing 
      a broad plain before arriving at the city of Aratta with its red-painted 
      city wall.</h4>
      <h4><font color="#990066"><i>The envoy, journeying to Aratta, covered his 
      feet with the dust of the road and stirred up the pebbles of the 
      mountains. ? Five gates, six gates, seven gates he traversed. ? Like a 
      huge serpent prowling about in the plain, he was unopposed. ? He lifted up 
      his eyes as he approached Aratta. [extracts from 'Enmerkar and the Lord of 
      Aratta']</i></font></h4>
      <h4><font color="#009900">Here, the Sumerian word for 'plain' is edin which 
      some scholars believe is the source of the word Eden in 
      Genesis.</font></h4>
      <h4>So, combining Walker's discovery of the four rivers together with the 
      Sumerian location of Eden, it seemed as though the whereabouts of the lost 
      Eden and its fabled garden was near to being resolved. I decided to set 
      out for the ancient city of Susa (burial place of Daniel of the lions' 
      den) in the south-western flood plain of Iran (Iraq was off bounds for 
      obvious reasons) from where I determined to retrace the Sumerian envoy's 
      route to paradise.</h4>

      <h4><i>The location of Eden (red shading) in Western Iran and Eastern 
      Turkey.</i></h4></center>
      <h4>Following the ancient track through the seven 'gates', I eventually 
      reached the Miyandoab plain to the south of Lake Urmia. The journey had 
      taken four days by car but would have taken the envoy the best part of 
      four months by donkey. The edin remains today one of the lushest regions 
      of the Middle East: thick soil, fruit orchards and vineyards, lazy 
      meandering rivers. This, I am sure, was the original heart of Eden which, 
      over time, became a much wider area, including both the salt lakes and the 
      Garden of Eden itself. The Bible describes the latter as being 'east in 
      Eden' - in other words to the east of but still within the wider territory 
      of Eden.</h4>
      <h4>My driver and I continued eastwards, between the south-eastern shore 
      of Lake Urmia and the towering volcanic peak of Mount Sahand. An hour's 
      drive along the highway brought us into a long west to east valley, the 
      slopes of which were terraced with 'every kind of tree' smothered in 
      spring blossom</h4>
      <h4><font color="#990066"><i>God planted a garden in Eden, which is in the 
      east, and there he put the man he had fashioned. From the soil, God caused 
      to grow every kind of tree, enticing to look at and good to eat. [Genesis 
      2:8-9]</i></font></h4>
      <h4>All around a high snow-laden ring enclosed the valley, nurturing its 
      warm micro-climate. The nearest mountain to the north glowed bright red in 
      the low evening light - a pile of pure red ochre. At its foot sprawled the 
      regional capital of Tabriz, squatting at the centre of the valley where 
      Adam and Eve (whoever they were) once lived according to biblical 
      tradition. The first thing which came to mind was paradise lost. Nothing 
      of the earthly garden and its settlement could have survived beneath these 
      bustling streets. But then, away from the city, I soon discovered that 
      there was much that remains of Adam's Neolithic culture.</h4>

      <h4>This was the region where Man first began to settle down to sedentary 
      life; where he learnt to domesticate animals and plant his crops; and 
      where he began to bury his dead in graves, the bones painted in red-ochre. 
      Adam's name means the 'red-earth' man. According to Sumerian mythology, 
      Man was crafted by the gods from the clay of the earth, just as a potter 
      throws his red clay pots on the wheel. The creation of Man in Genesis is 
      much the same.</h4>
      <h4><font color="#990066"><i>Yahweh God shaped Man (Heb. Adam) from the dust

      you shall return. [Genesis 3:19]</i></font></h4>
      <h4>Here the word 'dust' is a poetical translation. The understanding of 
      Hebrew aphar is the earth from which clay is made, or simply clay itself, 
      and I believe the clay which gave Adam his name was sourced in the red 
      mountain looking down on Tabriz. Throughout many prehistoric cultures (and 
      including the later Mesoamerican civilisations such as the Maya) the 
      daubing of human bones in red paint or powder was a substitute for the 
      life-blood which had been lost with the decaying flesh.</h4>

      <h4>The Hebrew word for 'garden' used in Garden of Eden is gan which has 
      the meaning 'walled' or 'enclosed garden'. The enclosed valley of the Adji 
      Chay is just that - a rich-soiled paradisiacal haven protected by high 
      mountain walls. The Greek version of the Old Testament calls the Garden of 
      Eden 'Paradise' (paradeisos) after the ancient Persian pairidaeza meaning 
      'enclosed parkland'. The great Meidans (royal squares) of Islamic Persia, 
      particularly the beautiful Meidan-? Imam of Isfahan, are symbolic 
      representations of the original Garden of Eden with their high enclosures 
      and formal gardens containing fountains and pools.</h4>
      <h4>When the descendants of the Mongol chieftains who had invaded Persia 
      in the 13th century moved on into India to become the Mogul emperors of 
      the 16th to 19th centuries, they took the Persian ideas relating to the 
      Garden of Eden with them. So it was that Shah Jehan built the Taj Mahal 
      for his beloved queen, Muntaz Mahal, not simply as a mausoleum but as a 
      representation of heaven itself - with the mausoleum functioning as the 
      Throne of God. Jehan was effectively recreating the paradise on earth 
      which had been lost to humanity following the expulsion of Adam and Eve 
      from the Garden of Eden. A study of the Koranic inscriptions around the 
      arches of the Taj, undertaken by Professor Wayne E. Begley of Iowa 
      University, has shown that this was the hidden secret of the building - 
      the sacred knowledge of Eden brought out of Sufic Iran.</h4>

      <h4>However, now that the landscape of Eden and its garden have finally 
      been identified, I believe we are in a position to read much more into 
      this extraordinary 17th-century monument to one man's vanity.</h4>
      <h4><font color="#990066"><i>I shall scale the heavens. Higher than the 
      stars of God I shall set my throne. I shall sit on the Mountain of the 
      Assembly far away to the north. I shall climb high above the clouds; I 
      shall rival the Most High. [Isaiah 14:13-14]</i></font></h4>
      <h4>The Taj Mahal's glistening white dome, can be seen as a representation 
      of the snow-capped Mount Sahand - the original exalted throne of God. The 
      formal gardens in front of the Taj mirror the garden of paradise with the 
      central pool (representing Lake Urmia) and the four water channels 
      (representing the four rivers of Eden) flowing out from the centre of the 
      complex. The ornamental arch leading into the enclosed garden of the Taj 
      Mahal represents the mountain pass or 'gate' leading into Eden which was 
      ferociously guarded by the cherubim and the Fiery Flashing Sword. The 
      symbolism is striking.</h4>
      <center>
      <h4>******</h4></center>
      <h4>But, back in the real Garden of Eden, we still have much more to 
      discover. Even further to the east of the Adji Chay valley and Tabriz, 
      beyond a high pass leading out of the Garden of Eden, is the land of Nod 
      into which Cain was exiled after he had murdered his brother Abel. The 
      area is still today called Upper and Lower Noqdi and many villages bear 
      the epithet Noqdi ('belonging to Nod').</h4>
      <h4>In the same region we find the town of Kheruabad. The name means 
      'settlement of the Kheru-people' and the Kheru were the Kerubim (Cherubs) 
      of Genesis who protected the eastern entrance into Eden. The volcanic peak 
      which guards the eastern gateway back into the Garden of Eden is a good 
      candidate for the 'Fiery Flashing Sword' associated with the Kerubim. When 
      I travelled over the pass beneath Savalan volcano for the first time, the 
      vehicle was pounded by a violent electrical storm. To the ancients, used 
      to the metaphor of jagged peaks as divine swords or spears, it would have 
      been easy to envisage the angry mountain, casting down its bolts of 
      lightening, as the Fiery Flashing Sword of Genesis.</h4>

      Ahar Chay is a major tributary of the Gaihun-Aras/Gihon which, according 
      to Genesis 2 'winds all through the land of Cush'. My map confirmed once 
      more that we really were in the primordial landscape of Adam and Eve. 
      Separating the Ahar and Adji valleys, and acting as the northern wall of 
      the Garden of Eden, stretched a high snow-capped ridge named Kusheh Dagh - 
      the 'Mountain of Cush'.</h4>

      invasion of Persia in the 13th century when a group of settlers occupied 
      the village. But none of today's locals have memories beyond the arrival 
      of their Asiatic ancestors. Did the village exist before that time? It 
      seems highly likely, given the complex agricultural terracing which covers 
      the steep-sided valleys around the holy mountain. Assyrian war annals of 
      the 8th century BC mention towns in the vicinity of Mount Uash (the 
      Assyrian name for Sahand volcano) and these population centres would have 
      required considerable agricultural produce which must have been eked out 
      of the volcanic soil clinging to the slopes of Sahand. Beyond the 8th 
      century BC we cannot go with any certainty, but Neolithic occupation 
      around Lake Urmia and Mount Sahand has been confirmed by limited 
      archaeological investigations. Of the thousands of ancient occupation 
      mounds surveyed in this region only a tiny percentage have been excavated. 
      We have just begun to scratch the surface in the land where human 
      civilisation began.</h4>
      <h4>Whatever the ancient history of Kandovan, the soul of the place is 
      timeless. Hardly anything has changed over the centuries - until very 
      recently, that is, when electricity was piped up from Tabriz. The only 
      other concession to the modern world is a fag shop and a picnic area for 
      Tabrizi weekend tourists. They come up the mountain armed with plastic 
      containers to collect the water which flows down from the nearby summit of 
      the mountain. This water is regarded as having magical properties: it 
      cures the sick and prolongs life. Many a grandma or grandpa in Tabriz are 
      fed the holy water of Mount Sahand to keep them fit and strong. The reason 
      for this veneration is all to do with the sacred source of the river which 
      runs through the Garden of Eden.</h4>
      <h4>At the summit of one of the two peaks of Sahand the extinct volcanic 
      chimney overflows with ice-cool water as if from a bottomless well. The 
      locals call it Jam Daghi - 'Mountain of the Chalice'. The water which 
      gurgles from the tiny lake joins other streams, flows past Kandovan and on 
      down into the Adji Chay valley, eventually forming a marshy delta on the 
      eastern shore of Lake Urmia.</h4>
      <h4><font color="#990066"><i>A river flowed from Eden to water the garden, 
      and from there it divided to make four streams (Hebrew roshim meaning 
      'heads'). [Genesis 2:10]</i></font></h4>
      <h4>In Sumerian theology spring-water lakes on top of mountains were 
      regarded as holy places where humans might communicate with the great god 
      of the underworld ocean of sweet water upon which the earth floated. Such 
      an interface between the worlds of the living and dead was called an abzu, 
      from which we get our word abyss. The god of the abzu was known to the 
      Sumerians as Enki ('Lord of the Earth') - the creator of humankind and the 
      'friend of Man'. The Akkadians and Babylonians knew him as Ea (pronounced 
      ?ya) and it was this Ea who warned the Mesopotamian hero of the flood of 
      the impending destruction of mankind by the storm-god, Elil (Sumerian 
      Enlil). Could Ea, god of the Sahand abyss, have been the deity worshipped 
      by Adam and Noah? You will have to wait for another day for the story of 
      the flood when I will reveal the hidden name borne by the god of the 
      Israelite ancestors.</h4>

      <h4>Meanwhile, the troglodyte village of Kandovan with its volcanic spires 
      was as close as I could get to Adam's world. I had travelled over one 
      thousand kilometres from the Mesopotamian plain to the Garden of God. I 
      had crossed seven mountain ridges, through the ancient lands of Kuzestan, 
      Luristan and Kurdistan. I had followed in the footsteps of Enmerkar's 
      weary envoy as he crossed over into the mysterious land of Aratta and, 
      beyond, I had found myself in the primeval world of Adam and Eve. I was 
      literally in Seventh Heaven. My journey had come to an end just below the 
      summit of God's holy mountain. The Exalted Throne of God was within reach, 
      a thousand metres above me, but sadly not this time. Dark clouds had 
      enveloped the mountain and falling snow began to shroud the way forward. 
      My meeting with God would have to wait for another time. I headed down the 
      mountain, leaving Pinocchio and his friends to their own devices.</h4>
      <h4><font color="#990066"><i>Son of Man, raise a lament ? You were in Eden, 
      in the Garden of God ? I made you a living creature with outstretched 
      wings, as guardian, you were upon the holy Mountain of God, you walked in

      God and destroyed you, guardian winged creature, amid the coals. [Ezekiel

<p></p><center><b>And the tradition continues!</b></center>
<p>"Since Israel attained its independence (May 14, 1948), the total area under cultivation 
has increased from 408,000 acres (165,000 ha.) to some 1.07 million acres 
(435,000 ha.), and the number of agricultural communities has grown from 
400 to 725. During the same period, agricultural production has expanded 
16-fold, more than three times the population growth."</p><p>
<b>"Israel's Agricultural Exports: Total: $590 million"</b></p><p>

"Agricultural projects and research collaboration constitute about half of all 
Israel's international co-operation programs. Emphasis is placed on training 
courses in agricultural subjects, with some 1,400 participants from over 80 
countries attending specialised farming courses in Israel every year. In 1994 
alone over 3,000 trainees received on-the-spot training in their own countries. 
Since 1958, thousands of Israeli agricultural experts have been sent abroad on 
long- and short-term assignments." (from http://www.israel-embassy.org.uk/ web/pages/ 
agrisrel.htm, "Agriculture in Israel")</p><p> 
As the prophet Amos wrote about 750 B.C.
</p><center><b>"And I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel,<br>
            and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them:<br>
						and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof;<br>
						They shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.<br> 
						And I will plant them upon their land, ..."</b><br>
