                    We have used AquaOne Pool Service for the last 7 years. With Fred's advice, we re-plastered and installed new tile this year. It really looks great. Fred walked us through the process and helped us make various, important decisions on the project. Fred and his staff are always available for emergencies and reliable the rest of the time.<br>

                    AquaOne Pool Service has been servicing my pool the last few years. My pool service guys are courteous, professional and they take pride in their work. And they don't goof off when their working on my swimming pool.<br>

                    Martin and I wanted to thank you and your company for your expertise, knowledge and pool service. We recently bought our home in South Barrington and with every new home purchase are new discoveries of "things to repair" and the overwhelming feeling of the money pit.
We called over 10 pool companies and had 3 people come out, basically shopped around.  We wanted to write an email to thank you for taking the time to educated both of us on separate days regarding our pool equipment. It was important for us that a company could educate us on our new pool and you were more than willing to spend extra time for our 100 plus questions. Also, your company was the only one that could identify that we had 2 separate chlorine systems and could identify how to operate the waterfall. We highly recommend you and AquaOne Pool Service to anyone who wants a clean and crystal clear pool that is safe for everyone to enjoy! We look forward in working with you to design a pool cover and winterize our pool.  We are so thankful that we get to enjoy the pool this summer.<br>

                    AquaOne has provided our family the ultimate in pool care and service. We had very disappointing experiences with several pool services prior to AquaOne. We have found AquaOne to exceed our expectation at EVERY service. The entire crew is extremely
knowledgeable and trustworthy. They are guided by the owner of AquaOne, Fred, who
we have come to depend on and trust for the quality of our pool care and the health of our
family. He is genuinely honest in providing care and service and makes sure the owner is
fully aware of what?s going on with their equipment, water, and chemical treatments. We
have dogs that love the water, and Fred makes sure he leaves me instructions after every
service for the safety of our pets and our family. AquaOne is prompt, efficient, reliable,
and provides absolutely OUTSTANDING service. You can rest assured that Fred and his
team will give you and your family the impeccable service and trusted care you deserve.
This is the team I will continue to trust for the maintenance of my pool and the health and
safety of my family.<br>

                    AquaOne Pool Service is the best service organization that I've used at my home (and I've used many). Fred has always delivered exactly what he promised - on time and very well. I wish all organizations were as professional and reliable as AquaOne. <br><br>Pool Renovation Work<br><b>Jamie Curcio, Palatine</b>

The pool looks great and the work was done with expertise and professionalism. We will definitely use AquaOne for all our future pool services<br><br><b>Randy Look<br>President<br>Sound &amp; Video<br>Deer Park</b></div>
